# Requesting More Content

This guide exists to inform people how Gavel can be used at their event, and general best practices when using it. We will, of course, continue to make periodic additions to this guide as we see fit, but understand that we may not capture all the requirements of the community. 

We'll do our best to fulfill all requests, as long as they're reasonable.

To make a request, simply head over to [the repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/weareasterisk/gavel/issues) and [create a new issue](https://github.com/weareasterisk/gavel/issues/new)! Title it appropriately, and let us know exactly what you need inside the issue description. Make sure that you've looked around the site before making a request; what you may request could already exist!

::: tip
Remember that you can always [fork the repo](https://github.com/weareasterisk/gavel) and [make a pull request](https://github.com/weareasterisk/gavel/pulls) if you want to add anything to the guide yourself!
