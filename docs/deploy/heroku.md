Deployment on heroku is fairly easy. All you have to do is click the button below, and go through the configuration steps as outlined.

You will initially land on a page that looks like this:

Name the application whatever you would like. Make sure you remember it though, because this will be important in the future.

After you've set the name of the application, scroll down to **config vars** section and **refer to [the configuration page](/deploy/configuration) for more guidance on how to set up and configure gavel.**
