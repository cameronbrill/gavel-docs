# Getting Started With Gavel

Gavel is a full stack application built using [Flask][flask]. It doesn't require a large amount of resources to run in a "normal" judging session. Something low-resource such as [Heroku Free Tier][herokufree] should suffice.

[flask]: http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/
[herokufree]: https://www.heroku.com/free
